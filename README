This is a script that automates the task of taking versioned backups of your filesystems.
I know there are so many such scripts out there that I could just have named it YABS (yet another
backup script) but this name is probably already taken.
I decided to make it public, because it really helped me with my backups policy. It isn't an
original idea, rather an implentation of guides I read in the past that turned out to work rather
well.


So, what it really does, is to copy the folder you want to backup to the backup directory (while
preserving ownerships, attributes, special files, links, etc).
This happens for the first backup though. For the next backups, it creates a hard link copy or a
snapshot (if you are using btrfs) of the most recent backup and copies only the changed files.
This makes the process very quick and the space needed for a new version relatively small. On the
same time, your backups are directories, you can browse them, copy them, mount them or do
anything you like without special software.


This is the thing I need most from a backup: a backup that works and doesn't need special tools or
maintenance. Any recovery function, whether it be for a single file or the whole filesystem, should
be able to be performed as quick as possible by anyone with a shell (your system, a live cd,
anything) and no special tools. mrbStudio only creates backups, you don't need it for accessing or
restoring them. It does not do that.


Features:
 - Versioned backups of local and remote filesystems (through ssh) to a local filesystem.
 - Easy to run once you create your configuration files, no need to postpone your backups again.
 - Hard links or btrfs snapshots are used for backup versions in order to save time and space.
 - Easy way to exclude files from backups.
 - Automatic mounting of local and/or remote filesystems if needed.
 - Backups are exact copies of the original directories, no special software needed to access them,
   only a shell.
 - Script is compact and easy to modify. You need an extra feature? You can implement it fast.

 
How it works? You create a configuration file for each filesystem you want to backup. Check the
sample.mrbStudio and the examples to get the idea; it is easy.
Then you just call it with the configuration file:
$ mrbStudio sample.mrbStudio


mrbStudio does not support removing old backups. You have to do this manually.


A last note; mrbStudio isn't rocket science and certainly isn't an advanced bash script. One should
not play with his backups, they are there to save you from a catastrophe. So, I intentionally kept it
basic. What it really does is to make a bunch of checks to see if your configuration file is sane (you
will probably run it as root, so you don't want things to go wrong) and then calls rsync.
Essentially it is a wrapper for rsync.


Changelog
 Version 3 - 2012, Jun 13:
     - added btrfs snapshot support
     - replaced cp -l with rsync --link-dest option (much faster for large filesystems)
     - code restructure and clean up in order to release in public
     - excluded files' list may be inside a main configuration file instead of a seperate file
     - better documentation
     - caution: this version changed the names of some variables, so older configuration files may need changes
 Version 2 - 2012, Jan 12:
     - added versioned backup for remote linux systems through ssh and rsync
 Version 1 - 2009, Jun 30:
     - versioned backup of local fileystems
